  "Description": "\r\n  This is the README for the XCOM: Chimera Squad mod 'Difficulty is Okay.' \r\n\r\n  This mod fixes a minor bug which makes mission difficulty harder between the 1st and 2nd Operations of Act 1. \r\n  \r\n  ## Background\r\n  \r\n  One thing that affects mission difficulty is the 'stage.' Each Act/faction has 5 stages: Groundwork, each Operation, and Takedown. \r\n  \r\n  Mission difficulty--Easy/Medium/Difficult/Very Difficult--is set in XComTacticalMissionManager.CalculateAlertLevelFromDifficultyParams(). \r\n  That function gets the stage number via XComGameState_Investigation.CalcStageDifficultyValue(). The latter function has a bug, where the value may be +1.\r\n  \r\n  As mods can't modify the source code directly, we add to it:\r\n  \r\n  > Override XComGameState_MissionSite.InitMissionDifficulty(). From there, we bypass XComGameState_Investigation.CalcStageDifficultyValue() with our own function.\r\n  \r\n  If there's a bug with this mod, you can post to reddit (e.g., xcom2mods) or email me at geoff.hom@gmail.com. Please include the Combat and/or Launch logs. \r\n  \r\n  > Tip: You can see the bug clearly via the Balance log of a new campaign. For the first mission, it'll show like:\r\n  \r\n  [3047.73] XCom_Maps: ******************** Building Encounters ********************\r\n  [3047.73] XCom_Maps: \t\tDay: [0]\r\n  [3047.73] XCom_Maps: \t\tDifficulty Params: Act:[1] Stage:[1] District:[0]\r\n  \r\n  then for the 2nd mission(s):\r\n  \r\n  [13166.06] XCom_Maps: \t\tDay: [1]\r\n  [13166.06] XCom_Maps: \t\tDifficulty Params: Act:[1] Stage:[3] District:[0]\r\n  \r\n  If the mod is working, then on Day 1, the Stage should be 2, not 3.\r\n    \r\n  > Tip: This mod prints to the Balance log so you know it's working. Search for 'Difficulty is Okay.'\r\n  \r\n  > Tip: Missions that have already been created won't be fixed. You have to have the mod working the day before.\r\n  \r\n  > Tip: Mod code is at https://github.com/geoffhom/Difficulty-is-Okay.\r\n  \r\n  ## Requirements\r\n  \r\n  The mod overrides XComGameState_MissionSite.InitMissionDifficulty(). In that function, this mod bypasses XComGameState_Investigation.CalcStageDifficultyValue().\r\n  ",
